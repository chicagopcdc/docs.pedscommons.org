This guide is intended for the individuals tasked with transforming an existing dataset into the PCDC format. These individuals typically have a variety of backgrounds (statisticians, data scientists, data managers, clinicians, etc.), but this guide will refer to such individuals as data analysts . Resources Data analysts should have been provided with what D4CG calls a Data Contributor Bundle . This is a spreadsheet consisting of three main components: README - notes and guidance for your specific dataset. Data Dictionary - tables, variables, and permissible values that constitute the target data format. Data Sheets - with one sheet per data dictionary table, these are meant to contain your data once transformed and will be described in detail below. If you have not received a Data Contributor Bundle, please reach out the the D4CG Data Standards and Modeling (DSM) team. What has already been done? The data dictionary you will use is the result of many months of modeling work by disease experts in your consortium. Your browser does not support the video tag. How long will this take? Pilot The easiest way for the data analyst to learn the target data format, troubleshoot missing values or errors in the data dictionary, and to establish lines of communication with the DSM team is by starting the data transformation process with a small pilot of 3-5 patients . This isn't intended to take long, hopefully just a few days in the first few weeks. We haven't had any groups who have not come back to the DSM team with questions at some point, and the most successful have been those who begin the pilot right away and quickly identify roadblocks. Full The full transformation process for each dataset depends on a variety of factors. The DSM team will plan on making quarterly contact with data analysts to ensure that any roadblocks are resolved without too much interim time lost. Ad hoc meetings between the data analysts and the DSM team are also highly encouraged whenever question or issues arise. The Data Contributor Bundle Your browser does not support the video tag. Table guidance Each table has a specific instruction as to how each observation should be encoded. For example: The Subject Characteristics table directs implementers to include \"One row per subject per study\" , \"row\" here meaning a row in the data sheet (specifically within the subject_characteristics data sheet). This row will describe a given patient's enrollment, data contributor, consortium, etc. Contrast that to the Laboratory Test table, which some data dictionaries utilize. This directs implementers to include \"One row per subject per test result\" . This means that a single patient may have multiple rows/observations in the laboratory_test data sheet, as opposed to the single row/observation per patient within the subject_characteristics data sheet. These are straightforward examples, while other tables may be more complicated and context dependent. We encourage all questions about table guidance statements to be sent to the D4CG DSM Team who can explain in more detail and provide additional examples. Implementation Notes D4CGNote - general guidance from the DSM team, applies across consortia. ConsortiumNote - specific guidance from the consortium data modeling group, applies to your consortium. ConditionalStatement - related to tiering. Tiering Resources are finite, so part of the data modeling process for some consortia have been to tier variables in the data dictionary. This is meant to communicate priorities to the data analysts. Tiers may be standalone, or they may include a ConditionalStatement (in the \"Implementation Notes\" columnn of the data dictionary) to accommodate the nuances of interrelated variables and observation type conditionals. Tier Example Explanation Mandatory lab_type The observation (lab result) doesn't make sense without this field (type of lab test). Priority resection_extent The observation should be included if it exists in the source data. Optional detection_method If the observation (imaging technique for a tumor assessment) is in the source data, then it would be nice to have. But it may not be directly relevant to priority research questions and could be skipped if resources are pressed. Example condition : ConditionalStatement: If PROCEDURE = 'Resection' Re-tiering The DSM team is happy to facilitate any re-tiering sessions that may be requested by the data analysts. This would involve a comprehensive review of all variables by a consortium group that is organized from those who previously worked on the data dictionary and those who are familiar with the datasets in question. Completed Data Transformation Box Folder The University of Chicago uses Box, a cloud-based storage service, to store and share sensitive, confidential, or restricted information. A folder will be created for your institution by the D4CG Tech team which is where you can upload the transformed data for QA/QC. Data should not be shared with D4CG until a Data Contributor Agreement (DCA) has been fully executed for your institution. QA/QC Quality assurance and quality control checks are a vital step before data can be loaded into the PCDC. The D4CG Tech team have an extensive process for checking conformance of submitted data to the target data dictionary, using abnormal or outlier values to detect erroneous observations, and finding gaps or inappropriate missingness. Uploaded to PCDC and available in the Data Portal Once the dataset has passed QA/QC, it will be queued for an upcoming data release. When released it will be searchable on the Data Portal. FAQs What does _undefined_ mean? The tabular version of the data dictionaries (viewed on Google Sheets) are designed to be parsed by code. To help with this parsing, each row in the spreadsheet has been given a \"RowType\". The _undefined_ cell values are added so that permissible values are not defined on the same row as a variable. It is not a valid permissible value for any enumerated variable. If source data is missing, or a certain variable is not applicable to the observation being reported, you should not use _undefined_ , but rather should use Not Reported or just be left blank as explained below. \\<blank> vs Not Reported Each enumerated variable will have a list of permissible values. Most of these permissible value lists will include one for Not Reported . This should be used for missing source data. However, there will also be times when the table in the data dictionary will have variables that are not related to a certain observation. To extend the tiering example above, the variable recontruction_type will not apply for a row/observation that is describing a biopsy. In these instances, the field should be left blank. To summarize: If the field is missing in the source dataset, then use Not Reported . If the field is not applicable to a row/observation, then leave blank. SUBMITTER_ID format Despite what you may see in screenshots, examples, or other documentation, there is no prescribed format for submitter_id fields. The only requirement is that they are internally unique and consistent. Time Periods Time Periods are by far the most confusing aspect of the PCDC data model and usually require careful explanation and many examples. Privacy laws prohibit dates being included in de-identified datasets, which is why the PCDC model requires the age in days for events. However, it is common for an observation to not be date-stamped in the source data, but rather be attributed to a certain \"phase\" of disease (e.g., relapse or progression), or even to a \"course\" of treatment (e.g., induction or consolidation). Thus, the PCDC data model allows an observation to have a specific age in days (for date-stamped source data), or to have a reference to a predefined time period (for source data with no date stamps). Groups will also commonly use both age in days and time periods if that information is known. Consider the following vignette and visualization that demonstrate the use of time periods: A 13 month-old patient is diagnosed with neuroblastoma and enrolled on a clinical trial. Her initial imaging shows a primary tumor in the adrenal gland and a metastasis in the liver. Her trial protocol calls for 3 week cycles of induction therapy followed by consolidation therapy. She shows a partial response to the treatment. Relapse is diagnosed a little over 1 year later in one of her lymph nodes. She is given additional cycles of re-induction therapy and subsequent consolidation therapy. Once declared, these time periods can then be used to organize all of the reported data for the patient. This is done by using submitter_ids. A unique SUBMITTER_ID is declared for each time period and used throughout the rest of the tables in the data model, as shown below: last updated: 04/14/25 authored by: mwatkins","title":"Data Contribution Guide"},{"location":"DataContributionGuide/#pcdc-data-contribution-guide","text":"","title":"PCDC Data Contribution Guide"},{"location":"DataContributionGuide/#who-is-this-guide-for","text":"This guide is intended for the individuals tasked with transforming an existing dataset into the PCDC format.

Headquartered at the University of Chicago, the PCDC works with international leaders in pediatric cancers and the US National Cancer Institute to develop and apply uniform data standards, facilitating the collection, combination, and analysis of data from many different sources. By harmonizing existing clinical research data and leading international efforts to standardize data collection, we are breaking down long-standing barriers that have held back advancements in research on rare diseases. Our aim is to leverage this unique collaborative consortium-based approach to enable new and meaningful discoveries about pediatric cancers. The PCDC Data Portal supports the management, analysis and sharing of data for the research community. The portal includes a data dictionary and data search functionality. For additional information, users can watch this introductory video . Access The PCDC Data Portal can be accessed using a web browser by visiting https://portal.pedscommons.org/ . New users to the PCDC Data Portal are prompted to login using an approved authentication provider (i.e., Google). After successfully logging in with Google for the first time, users are prompted to associate their account with the PCDC Data Portal. Registration of an account with the PCDC Data Portal requires users to provide their email (supplied by the authentication provider), first name, last name, and institutional affiliation (e.g. University of California Berkeley). Registration also requires that users read and acknowledge agreement with the PCDC Privacy Notice , the PCDC Terms and Conditions , and the Acceptable Use Policy . Users who have previously registered an account will be taken directly to the main page of the PCDC Data Portal after authentication. Users will initially have access to summary data only. Researchers can request access to line-level data by clicking the Request Access button on the Exploration page. See the Exploration section below. Navigation After successful login, users will see the main page. The main navigation buttons to PCDC Data Portal pages are in the upper right-hand corner of the page: Dictionary Exploration Profile settings can be accessed by clicking the username at the top of the page.

Dictionary Dictionary is the data dictionary used to define the data in the portal, including what each entity (Node) represents, properties associated with the entities, and possible values. The Dictionary is accessed by clicking the Dictionary button in the top-right hand corner of the PDCD Data Portal main page. Example: for the data entity named \u201cCytology\u201d, the dictionary includes seven properties as shown below. Terms used in the dictionary that are defined in the NCIt (National Cancer Institute thesaurus) include a link next to the term showing the NCIt code. Clicking the link will open a browser tab to the NCIt site. On the right side of the Table View are Download Templates for each data element. Templates are available in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or TSV (tab separated values) format. Templates are used when submitting clinical trial data for use in the portal. The data dictionary can be viewed as a table, (shown above), or in graphical format by clicking on the Graph View button in the upper left. The Graph View shows an overview of the data model, which can be zoomed in to see individual components of the model and how they relate to one another. Clicking the Open Properties button will switch to the table view as shown above. How to find an item In the main page click the Dictionary button. The Dictionary page is displayed. Type the item you want to find in the Search in Dictionary field on the left of the page. Items that match your search are displayed as you type: Click the item in the list you want to display. The Graph View area of the screen will highlight Nodes that include the search term(s). The Search Results on the left side shows the number of matches in the Node title and description, as well as the number of matches in the node properties. The Last Search field shows the number of Nodes where the term appears \u2013 in this example: Click on the Node to see the properties. Matching search results are highlighted in amber text. Click on the See All button to toggle between matched results and all properties. Exploration The Exploration button at the top of the home page takes the user to the main data page allowing users to see summary data. Users can refer to this video for an overview of the Exploration functionality. For users who do not have access to line-level data, the top of the Exploration page will display a Request Access button. Clicking Request Access will redirect users to the PCDC Project Request Forms page. The page contains forms and instructions for requesting access to line-level data. The Table View tab on the main page is restricted to approved researchers who have access to line-level data. The current Release Version of the data is included at the bottom of the left panel. Filters and Search The Filters panel on the left side of the Exploration page can be used to narrow the Summary View results by selected variables. Filters act upon variables in the underlying data and are available for variables in the Subject , Disease , Molecular , etc. data domains. Use the expand icon (>) to see the controls available for a given filter. Note: some filters, such as Age at Censor Status have a slider to select an age range. Age is shown in days. Bin Size A bin size limit of five has been implemented for all data filters as an additional measure of participant privacy. Bin size refers to the minimum sample size reporting threshold. A lock icon will appear next to the filter that includes less than five subjects. Summary View The main Exploration page shows a summary view of distributions across some key demographic variables for all cases in the PCDC that match the currently-selected filters. Different variable types (e.g. continuous variables, discrete variables, categorical variables) will have different controls available. For example, Race is a categorical (enumerative) variable, and categorical variable filters can be selected using checkboxes with one checkbox per value within that variable. The user can select the values of a variable they are interested in as part of the population. Multiple selections within a single filter are treated as logical \u2018ORs\u2019. Therefore, a user who selects \u2018Asian\u2019 and \u2018Black or African American\u2019 would see a result set where the subjects have a Race value of either \u2018Asian\u2019 OR \u2018Black OR African American\u2019 Multiple selections made across multiple filters are treated as logical \u2018ANDs\u2019. Therefore, a user who selects \u2018Asian\u2019 and \u2018Black or African American\u2019 from the Race filter and who select \u2018Male\u2019 from the Sex filter would see a result set where the subjects have a Race value of either \u2018Asian\u2019 OR \u2018Black or African American\u2019 AND who have a Sex value of \u2018Male\u2019. Using the above example, the Active filter at the top of the graph view shows \u201cSex is \u201cMale\u201d AND \u201cRace is any of (logial OR) Black or African American, Asian\u201d. The AND can be switched to OR by clicking on the AND button between the two parts of the expression. Each filter can be removed by clicking on the \u201cx\u201d at the end of the string. For patient observations that may be captured longitudinally, for example Tumor Site within the Disease tab, users can restrict filtering activity to a specific disease phase (Initial Diagnosis or Relapse) with an Anchor filter by clicking one of the radio buttons under Disease Phase . For example, a user who was interested in patients with relapse disease of the bladder would select Relapse under Disease Phase and Bladder under Tumor Site to see the count of subjects that have an observation of relapse at the bladder. Note: when changing the Anchor filter (e.g., switching from Relapse to Initial Diagnosis), users must remove the associated filters, in this case: \u201cBladder\u201d, in order to see the filter options available under the new Anchor. Search Clicking on the search icon to the right of a filter name (e.g. Tumor Site) allows users to search for a specific value in a list of categorical levels by keyword, Matching categorical level values will appear if there is a full or partial match, allowing the user to select it. The filter value can be selected by checking the box next to the name. Once selected, the main page will show the filtered data set. To clear the search, the user can hit the \"x\" on the right side of the search box. <! (commented out this image) -> Selected Filters An underline in the filter name indicates that filters are active within that tab. In the below example, the Subject and Disease tabs have active filters. Clicking into the tabs will show which filters are selected (also underlined). In the example below, Initial Diagnosis is selected, along with Histology from within the Disease tab. Interdependent Filters Some filters have an interdependency. Example: selecting the 11q deletion molecular abnormality should be followed by a selection of Absent, Present, or Unknown from the Molecular Abnormality Result filters. Filter by Consortium The left panel includes a Consortium filter in the Subject tab which allows users to select the disease consortium data from which to create a cohort. Data is available from INRG (International Neuroblastoma Risk Group), INSTRuCT (INternational Soft Tissue saRcoma ConsorTium), MaGIC (Malignant Germ Cell International Consortium), and NODAL (hodgkiN lymphOma DatA coLlaboration) subjects. Include or Exclude Filters Most filters have an Include or Exclude mode below the filter name. By default, Include is selcted. Clicking on Exclude will show results for all but the selected filters. Filters Set Workspace Users can refer to this video for an overview of the Filter Sets and Survival Curve functionality. The Filter Set Workspace allows the user to manage multiple filter sets and switch among available filter sets to see summary statistics based on the filters selected in each set. Use the resizing handle in the lower right corner of the Workspace area to resize the window. The active filter is labeled in green on the far left. Each filter shows the expression statement that describes the filter set. Example: Filter Set Workspace commands allow the user to load, save and make changes to filter sets. The following commands are included: New : When at least one filter set is active, pressing New will add another, empty set. Compose : Allows the user to combine two or more saved filter sets using AND/OR logic. Duplicate : Copies the active filter set. Note: an empty set cannot be duplicated. Remove : Removes the active filter set from the workspace and makes the filter set at the top of the list active. Clear : Clears the filter selections from the active filter set. Remove all : Removes all filter sets from the Workspace. Load : Loads a saved filter set to the Workspace. The filter set can be the user's own saved filter set or a filter set defined by a shared token from another user (see \"Share\" below). Save : Saves the active filter set that has been newly created (i.e., not yet named). When a saved filter set is active, the Save button changes to Update . Share : Generates a token that can be emailed to other users to re-create the selected filter set. Only saved filter sets can be shared. Reset : When a change is made to the active filter, Reset will revert any changes to the saved version of the filter set. If the filter set was not previously saved, Reset will not be active. Delete : Deletes the selected filter set, removing it from the screen and from the user's saved filters. Saving a Filter Set Once a set of filters has been selected, a user can save the set by clicking Save . The user will be prompted to enter a name for the saved filter set. A description can also be added. When changes are made to a saved filter set, the Workspace will indicate the change by making the Reset button active. Clicking on Reset will revert any changes made to the original, saved filter set. To save changes to a filter set and keep the original, users can 1) use the Duplicate function, make changes to the new filter set, and 2) Save the new filter set with a new name. 1) Use Duplicate to Create a copy of the active filter set 2) Make changes to the new filter set and hit Save. Note, the new filter set has no name until it is saved. Using Compose to Combine Filter Sets The Compose function allows users to combine filter sets using AND/OR logic. Example: Selecting Compose in the Filter Workspace, the two separate filters shown below can be combined into one using a logical AND. Click Done when the desired filters are selected. The resulting filter is added to the Workspace and made Active. It can now be saved to the user's list of filters. Note: when using a Composed filter, the left filter panel becomes inactivated. Explore in An External Data Commons Some subjects within the PCDC can be further explored in external Data Commons'. Currently, Gabriela Miller Kids First (GMKF) and the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) are available for exploration. To explore subjects within an external commons: 1) Create a data set using the Filter Set Workspace. It is recommended users save their data set before using the \"Explore in\" function. Set the desired data set as \"Active\" by clicking on it within the Workspace. 2) Click on the Explore in button in the upper right part of the Exploration page. A pop-up window will open. The drop-down menu is used to select the external data commons. 3) Download the manifest. The \"Open in new tab\" button will activate after downloading the file. Follow the instructions on the target website to upload the manifest. Survival Analysis The PCDC platform includes a Survival Analysis tool that can display survival curves and Number at Risk tables. This tool will be available temporarily during a pilot phase to test the functionality and usability of the tool. When first accessing the survival curve generator, users must agree to follow the Acceptable Use Policy. Subsequent sessions will include a reminder of the terms whenever the Survival tab is first used. To create a survival curve, users must first select at least one filter set to analyze. Filter Sets can be created and saved using the procedure described above. Note: Only saved filter sets can be used to create a Survival Curve. Use the drop down labeled \u201cSelect Filter Set to Analyze\u201d to select a saved filter set, then click the Add button to add the filter set. Optionally, a user may select \u201cAll Subjects\u201d to see the entire data set. Additional filter sets can be added using the steps above. The \"Consortium\" information label shows which data are available to create a survival curve. Filter sets that include values from other consortia are disabled. Once selected, users can see the survival curve by hitting the Apply button at the bottom of the screen. Note: When changes are made to filter sets that are currently selected for the Survival curve, users must hit the Apply button after editing to see the changes reflected in the curve. Multiple data sets can be selected and shown simultaneously. In the example below, two data sets are used: one for male and one for female participants. Options The survival curve can be adjusted using the options available. The Consortium field indicates which disease groups have data available to create a survival curve. The Disallowed Variables field shows which variables cannot be used to create a survival curve. The Survival type drop down can be used to select Overall or Event-Free survival. Start time is used to select the start time of the x-axis. Default is zero (0). End time is used to select the maximum time (in years) that will appear on the x-axis. The default is five years. If left blank, the maximum number of years will be shown for which data is available. Time interval is used to determine the frequency of hash marks appearing on the x-axis, both on the survival curve and in the Number at risk table shown below the curve. Default is one year. Query The Query page is used to create queries using the GraphiQL tool. (additional information to be provided in a future release of the User Guide). User Menu The User Menu can be accessed by clicking on the user icon in the top right corner of the screen. The View Profile option allows users to make changes to their name and institutional affiliation. The View Profile page can also be used to create API Keys (additional information to be provided in a future release of the User Guide). Data Requests The Data Requests screen allows users to see the status of their data requests and, when approved, download data. At the top of the screen is a toggle button to see All Requests or only Approved Requests. Only users who are authorized to receive requested data will see the Download Data button activated when the data is ready.

This team performs several functions, including the following: Development of clinical data standards Data harmonization Technical infrastructure development and maintenance Assisting consortia in matters of governance, development of data dictionaries, and importing data into the commons Data contributors are pediatric researchers or research cooperative groups that contribute pediatric cancer data to the PCDC. The PCDC headquarters team partners with disease-specific consortia . Membership of disease-specific consortia includes clinical experts and statisticians, many of whom have played a role in developing and conducting clinical trials, and who are considered experts in their fields. Disease-specific consortia provide clinical expertise to aid in development of data dictionaries, work with data contributors to integrate data into the PCDC, and provide governance structure for handling disease-specific data. Users are researchers like you who wish to explore the data and conduct research on the data available within the commons. Where does the data come from and how is the data organized? All of the data in the PCDC were collected from research studies on pediatric cancer. Patients (or their parents/guardians) provided informed consent to participate in clinical trials, and data were collected using case report forms that were specific to the aims of the particular study. Data collection was not uniform across research studies. Case report forms may include different patient attributes, or they may capture the same attribute in different ways. For example, older clinical trials may not have captured data about specific molecular features because their clinical significance was not apparent at the time the trial was conducted. Data on tumor size may be collected in several different ways: as a continuous variable (e.g., 2.4 cm), as a \u201cbinned\u201d ordinal variable (2-3 cm), or as a binary variable, created using a dichotomous cutoff (<5 cm, >=5 cm). The process of transforming data from multiple trials into a common format that allows data to be integrated is called harmonization . The harmonization process relies on the development of a common data dictionary , which defines all of the data variables, including their clinical meaning, type of data (e.g., integer, boolean, enumerated categories), and permissible values. The data dictionary is developed by data analysts who work with clinical experts to determine the optimal way to represent data within a common data model. Data specific to a disease is included in a disease-specific data dictionary. Where possible, features that are common across diseases are represented in a harmonized, disease-agnostic data dictionary to facilitate cross-disease studies. How do I access data? Any user who registers is able to utilize the PCDC Cohort Explorer to identify how many patients share clinical characteristics of interest. On a limited pilot basis, the PCDC has also released a Kaplan-Meier survival curve generator . Plans are also underway to develop additional analytics tools, including a demographic table generator . These web-based tools are designed to be a starting point for investigators to explore the data that are available and perform preliminary analyses preparatory to formal research activities (e.g., sample size calculation). Technical documentation on using these tools is available here . Users wishing to perform further analyses (e.g., for publication) are required to submit a project request in order to obtain line-level access to the data. The project request will be forwarded to and reviewed by the applicable disease-specific consortia. If the project request is approved, the user will be provided with line-level access to the data, which can be analyzed using third-party statistical software outside of the PCDC web-based analytics tools. How do I access the data dictionaries? Data dictionaries can be found here . The PCDC data portal also includes a data dictionary explorer . Each data dictionary includes a \u201cReadme\u201d section, which describes how the dictionary was generated and how the dictionary is structured. The dictionary groups variables by categorical relations (e.g., subject characteristics, disease characteristics). Each variable includes a name, data type, human-readable description, mapping to NCI Thesaurus code, and in the case of enumerated code variables, permissible values. Do I need Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to analyze data from the PCDC? Data included within the PCDC have been de-identified/pseudonymized by removal of identifiers using the HIPAA Safe Harbor method . Because local policies and regulations may vary, researchers should check with their local institutions to determine whether institutional review board approval is required to analyze data from the PCDC. Analytic considerations What are the limitations of the data? Whenever data from heterogeneous sources are combined, there are inherent limitations. Researchers must remain informed on the appropriate statistical methods, and exercise caution regarding interpretation of results and making inferences in light of these limitations. Non-uniform treatment of patients Data within the PCDC include clinical trials conducted by different cooperative groups around the globe, and they also include studies that have been conducted over several decades. Pooling of data may not always be appropriate when patients are not treated uniformly for the following reasons: Patients treated on different research studies may receive different treatments. Patients treated on different study arms within a research study receive different treatments. Studies may have different inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., sampling bias). Studies may stratify risk differently, and treatment may differ according to risk stratification. Patients may be treated differently due to regional conventions and differences in treatment approach. Analyses that include data collected on older \u201clegacy\u201d clinical trials may not accurately reflect outcomes expected on more contemporary treatment regimens or when more contemporary supportive measures are followed. Researchers should take care to understand how patients were treated on each of the included studies. Whenever possible, researchers should review study protocols corresponding to the underlying research studies. Data recorded differently across studies Data collected on independently-conducted research studies may be described or recorded differently. For example, risk stratification schemes and staging systems may vary, and anatomical sites may be described differently or with varying degrees of specificity (e.g., hand vs. upper extremity). Moreover, terms that are similar but distinct in meaning may be used (e.g., second malignant neoplasm vs. secondary malignant neoplasm). The harmonization process aims to merge data which were recorded differently while minimizing loss in data fidelity. Researchers should carefully review the data dictionary and individual study protocol documents, when relevant, to understand how data were recorded on each study and may have been transformed during the harmonization process. Missing data Not all data fields were collected in all studies. There are several reasons for missing data, which researchers should be familiar with: Significance of the data field was not apparent at the time of the study (i.e., data was only collected in more contemporary studies). Data fields were not relevant to the study aims (i.e., intentionally not collected). Data are missing for individual patients (i.e., data was not recorded). Researchers should also understand that some data may be missing because it is not applicable to a given patient or disease. For example, some anatomical sites or clinical features may only apply to patients of a given sex. Moreover, features may be specific to one disease and not apply to others (e.g., disease-specific molecular features or staging classification system). In analyses where a variable under study does not apply to the population of interest, users should first filter out patients in whom the variable does not apply before applying other filters. Where possible, analysts should discriminate between data that are missing because they are truly unknown or not collected versus data that are missing because they are not applicable to a given patient or disease. Limitations of underlying studies The quality of evidence generated from studies influences the degree of certainty we can have that the study results accurately answer a clinical question. Quality of evidence can vary due to a variety of reasons, including inherent study limitations (e.g., study design), confounding factors, measurement of indirect outcomes, imprecision and reporting bias. Length of follow up may vary for individual subjects within a given study and across studies, which may affect outcome estimates. Statistical pitfalls The PCDC data portal allows users to perform analyses on the data using web-based analytics tools. Before using these tools, users should understand potential statistical pitfalls that should be avoided. All users of PCDC analytics tools must acknowledge that they understand these statistical pitfalls and agree to avoid them as a condition of use. Multiple comparisons problem Repeatedly performing inferential statistical tests of the same type, known as \u201cmultiple comparisons,\u201d will increase the Type I statistical error of each test, and increase the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. Example Consider the following example: A user is searching for demographic features which predict inferior outcome. The user performs 200 statistical tests, each comparing different groups of factors. The user identifies one set of demographic features which are associated with an inferior outcome, with a p-value of 0.04. Is this truly a statistically significant result? To answer this question, we must first consider what a p-value signifies. A p-value reflects the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis\u2013that there is no difference between groups\u2013is correct. In this example, a p-value of 0.04 means that there is a 4% probability (one in twenty five) of observing this result if the null hypothesis is true and there is no difference between groups. When a conventional significance level of 0.05 is used, if a p-value of 0.04 is resulted, the null hypothesis is rejected. In this example where the researcher performs 200 statistical tests comparing two groups, when one test is encountered that demonstrates an apparent difference with a 1 in 25 probability of observing this result if there is no true difference between groups, there is a reasonable likelihood that this observed difference does not actually reflect a true difference between groups but instead was observed due to chance. On the other hand, if the investigator only performed one analysis and observed a difference with a p-value of 0.04, there is a more reasonable likelihood that the observed difference reflects a true difference. Testing a large number of hypotheses is not necessarily problematic. However, when multiple analyses (comparisons) are performed, the significance level (p-value threshold for statistically significant results) must be adjusted to account for the fact that multiple comparisons were performed. For example, genome-wide association studies which attempt to identify which single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with a trait utilize a p-value threshold of 5 x 10 -8 for statistical significance to account for the extremely large number of hypothesis tests which are performed in these analyses and control for the False Discovery Rate (FDR). To avoid the multiple comparisons problem, we encourage investigators to establish a limited set of hypotheses, develop data analysis plans a priori, and utilize methods such as the Bonferroni correction or the Holm-Bonferroni method when appropriate. Involvement of an experienced statistician is strongly encouraged. P-hacking (\u201cdata dredging\u201d) P-hacking (also referred to as \u201cdata dredging\u201d) refers to indiscriminate performance of multiple hypothesis tests in search of a statistically significant result while failing to account for the multiple comparisons problem. P-hacking is a malicious form of statistical misconduct which is prohibited by the PCDC. The PCDC reserves the right to review user logfile data and revoke access in cases where P-hacking is suspected. Example Consider the following example: the user described in the above section performed 200 statistical tests in search of a statistically significant result that could be published in a medical journal. After indiscriminately conducting 199 analyses which did not yield a p-value less than 0.05, the user performs an analysis which identifies a difference with a p-value of 0.04. The user then publishes this result as a statistically-significant discovery while failing to report on or account for the 199 statistical tests which did not identify a difference. This is an example of p-hacking. One way to avoid p-hacking is to follow a hypothesis-driven approach, where a limited set of hypotheses are established a priori along with data analysis plans. To discourage p-hacking, the PCDC web-based survival curve generator does not report a p-value. Publication bias Publication bias occurs when the decision to publish (or report) the results of an experiment is influenced by the result. Typically, it occurs when negative research studies (i.e., those which fail to identify a statistically significant result) are not published. It is important to emphasize that reporting of negative research study findings is just as important as reporting statistically significant findings, as negative results still provide answers to clinically important questions. If a user performs preliminary hypothesis testing using the PCDC analytics tools and the results do not appear to reveal a potentially significant result, the user is encouraged to proceed with submitting a data request to gain access to the data, perform a formal analysis, and publish the result. Validation of study results When an analysis reveals an apparently-significant result, the ability to replicate the study findings using an external dataset provides further support that the study result is valid. This process is called external validation. Having partnered with many major cooperative groups which contribute data, the PCDC will be the largest publicly-available repository of clinical pediatric cancer data. For this reason, there may be limited datasets against which results can be externally validated. We encourage users to seek out datasets that may be suitable for use in external validation (e.g., recently-closed studies not yet included in the PCDC dataset). If an external validation dataset is not available or not large enough, an alternative approach to validate results is to partition the original data cohort into a Test Set and a Validation Set. The data may be randomly divided into Test and Validation sets, with stratification to ensure balance of factors that could potentially bias the primary endpoint. Statistical hypothesis tests are performed on the Test Set; if significant, the tests are repeated in the Validation set for confirmation. Importantly, the partitioning must be completed prior to performing any statistical tests. If an investigator has already performed an analysis on the entire dataset, it is no longer valid to split the data into separate Test and Validation sets to perform additional validation. Best practices for using analytics tools The PCDC, along with leadership from member consortia and statistician experts, has developed a set of \u201cbest practices\u201d for using analytics tools. Users are expected to abide by these best practices, as well as other generally-accepted statistical principles, when using the analytics tools Hypothesis-driven exploration Any analysis performed using data within the PCDC should be conducted to investigate a hypothesis that has been defined a priori. A hypothesis may be derived from casual clinical observations, previous clinical research, or observations made in the laboratory. Hypotheses may be posed as answers to clinical questions. Clinical questions are usually formulated as a PICO question: Population: What is the patient population of interest? Intervention/Indicator: What intervention or independent variable is of interest? Comparator: What group will you compare to? Outcome: What is the outcome of interest (endpoint measured within each experimental unit)? An example of a clinical question is as follows: P: Among patients with Stage M neuroblastoma who were diagnosed 2010-2020, I: is MYCN amplification C: compared to no MYCN amplification O: associated with inferior event-free survival? A hypothesis is an educated guess about the answer to the clinical question. For example, a hypothesis would be that, among patients with Stage M neuroblastoma diagnosed 2010-2020, MYCN amplification is associated with inferior event-free survival when compared to no MYCN amplification. Once a hypothesis is declared, a reproducible and statistically valid method for testing the hypothesis should be chosen. Every effort should be made to choose methods that reduce the risk of bias to ensure results are valid, and these methods should be declared a priori. Local hypothesis record Users of the PCDC who conduct analyses using analytics tools are expected to maintain a record where they document hypotheses. The purpose of maintaining a hypothesis record is to guard against the statistical pitfalls outlined above and to strengthen the credibility of the research findings by verifying that a hypothesis was declared before analysis began. The hypothesis record may be a paper-based document (e.g., spiral-bound notebook) or an electronic document (e.g., Google Document, Microsoft Word) which documents each hypothesis that was analyzed using analytics tools on the PCDC. Hypotheses should be declared in the record, along with the date and time the hypothesis is declared, before any analyses begin. It is strongly preferred to maintain the hypothesis record as a document on a cloud-based service with an auditable version history (e.g., Google Document); this provides third-party verification of the date and time the hypothesis was recorded. Users may also wish to record a brief summary of the results of analyses in the hypothesis record, though this is not required. Users should electronically submit hypothesis record entries (e.g., scanned copy of handwritten hypothesis record, digital file, link to \u201ccloud\u201d-based document) along with project requests when requesting line-level access to the data. Users who do not submit a hypothesis record with a project request may be requested to submit a hypothesis record, and failure to submit a hypothesis record may result in denial of a project request. In cases of possible or suspected statistical misconduct, user activity log data may be reviewed and compared to the submitted hypothesis record. Policies and restrictions on use of analytics tools To meet commitments to data contributors and member consortia, and to prevent misuse of data, the PCDC has developed policies which users are expected to abide by. Users should become familiar with the PCDC Terms of Use , Acceptable Use Policy , and Privacy Policy . Prohibition on distribution of outputs Users are strictly prohibited from distributing or publishing any data or results generated using PCDC data exploration tools, including demographic tables and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Users are permitted to maintain copies of preliminary analyses in a secured hypothesis record and to submit hypothesis record entries to the PCDC and member consortia along with project requests. Users who are interested in distributing or publishing data or results generated using data from the PCDC must submit a project request form, which will be reviewed by the applicable consortia. Any distribution or publication of results will be subject to publication policies set forth by individual consortia. Users must agree to abide by publication policies as a condition to being granted access to the data. If the PCDC or member consortia become aware of unauthorized distribution or publication of results generated using analytics tools, the PCDC reserves the right to revoke a user\u2019s access to tools. The PCDC also reserves the right to contact conference organizers and/or journals to alert them that the unauthorized distribution of results is in violation of PCDC policies and to request retraction of the abstract/paper. Review of user logs For security and abuse prevention purposes, all user activity on the PCDC analytics platform is logged, and logfiles are retained for several years. The PCDC does not routinely audit individual user logfile data but reserves the right to do so when it or its affiliates (e.g., disease-specific consortia), have reason to believe that policies have been violated. The PCDC may share identifiable logfile data with affiliates (e.g., member consortia, data contributors, scientific advisory committee) as it deems appropriate. The PCDC reserves the right to share identifiable logfile data with member consortia if one or more consortia request logfile data in connection with a project request. The PCDC may, from time to time, perform global audits where aggregate user activity and trends are assessed. If global audits reveal suspected violations of PCDC policies (e.g., users who perform a large number of queries), the PCDC may review individual logfile data in detail to investigate suspected abuse. The PCDC reserves the right to contact users to clarify how they are using the tools to identify if a policy violation has occurred. De-identified and/or aggregate user data derived from logs may be used or disclosed without limitation. Users seeking additional information about how data are handled are encouraged to review the PCDC Privacy Policy . Access The PCDC reserves the right to suspend or revoke access to its platform, including analytics tools, at its sole discretion for any reason. Data analytics attestation Users wishing to use analytics tools must attest that they Have reviewed this statistical manual in its entirety, understand the material within it, and agree to follow the principles set forth in the manual. Agree to not violate PCDC policies, including the Acceptable Use Policy and Terms of Use . Agree to not engage in p-hacking or other forms of statistical misuse. Agree to follow a hypothesis-driven approach with analyses and to maintain a local hypothesis record, which may be audited. Analytics tool pilot Users wishing to utilize analytics tools at initial launch will be participating in a pilot release. The purpose of the pilot release is to collect data about how users utilize self-service analytics tools in order to inform more broad implementation of the tools across various consortia with additional datasets. The pilot will include review of aggregate user logfile data. Individual user logfile data will also be reviewed in cases of possible, suspected or confirmed misuse or abuse of the tools. Users may be contacted and invited to participate in a survey regarding their use of self-service analytics tools, and survey participation is voluntary. Data submitted to consortia as part of a project request may also be analyzed as part of the pilot. Results of the pilot project, including aggregate statistics and narrative descriptions of possible, suspected or confirmed misuse or abuse of the tools, may be distributed without limitation.

The user then publishes this result as a statistically-significant discovery while failing to report on or account for the 199 statistical tests which did not identify a difference. This is an example of p-hacking. One way to avoid p-hacking is to follow a hypothesis-driven approach, where a limited set of hypotheses are established a priori along with data analysis plans. To discourage p-hacking, the PCDC web-based survival curve generator does not report a p-value.","title":"P-hacking (\u201cdata dredging\u201d)"},{"location":"StatisticalManual/#publication-bias","text":"Publication bias occurs when the decision to publish (or report) the results of an experiment is influenced by the result. Typically, it occurs when negative research studies (i.e., those which fail to identify a statistically significant result) are not published. It is important to emphasize that reporting of negative research study findings is just as important as reporting statistically significant findings, as negative results still provide answers to clinically important questions. If a user performs preliminary hypothesis testing using the PCDC analytics tools and the results do not appear to reveal a potentially significant result, the user is encouraged to proceed with submitting a data request to gain access to the data, perform a formal analysis, and publish the result.","title":"Publication bias"},{"location":"StatisticalManual/#validation-of-study-results","text":"When an analysis reveals an apparently-significant result, the ability to replicate the study findings using an external dataset provides further support that the study result is valid. This process is called external validation. Having partnered with many major cooperative groups which contribute data, the PCDC will be the largest publicly-available repository of clinical pediatric cancer data. For this reason, there may be limited datasets against which results can be externally validated. We encourage users to seek out datasets that may be suitable for use in external validation (e.g., recently-closed studies not yet included in the PCDC dataset). If an external validation dataset is not available or not large enough, an alternative approach to validate results is to partition the original data cohort into a Test Set and a Validation Set. The data may be randomly divided into Test and Validation sets, with stratification to ensure balance of factors that could potentially bias the primary endpoint. Statistical hypothesis tests are performed on the Test Set; if significant, the tests are repeated in the Validation set for confirmation. Importantly, the partitioning must be completed prior to performing any statistical tests. If an investigator has already performed an analysis on the entire dataset, it is no longer valid to split the data into separate Test and Validation sets to perform additional validation.","title":"Validation of study results"},{"location":"StatisticalManual/#best-practices-for-using-analytics-tools","text":"The PCDC, along with leadership from member consortia and statistician experts, has developed a set of \u201cbest practices\u201d for using analytics tools. Users are expected to abide by these best practices, as well as other generally-accepted statistical principles, when using the analytics tools","title":"Best practices for using analytics tools"},{"location":"StatisticalManual/#hypothesis-driven-exploration","text":"Any analysis performed using data within the PCDC should be conducted to investigate a hypothesis that has been defined a priori. A hypothesis may be derived from casual clinical observations, previous clinical research, or observations made in the laboratory. Hypotheses may be posed as answers to clinical questions. Clinical questions are usually formulated as a PICO question: Population: What is the patient population of interest? Intervention/Indicator: What intervention or independent variable is of interest? Comparator: What group will you compare to? Outcome: What is the outcome of interest (endpoint measured within each experimental unit)? An example of a clinical question is as follows: P: Among patients with Stage M neuroblastoma who were diagnosed 2010-2020, I: is MYCN amplification C: compared to no MYCN amplification O: associated with inferior event-free survival? A hypothesis is an educated guess about the answer to the clinical question. For example, a hypothesis would be that, among patients with Stage M neuroblastoma diagnosed 2010-2020, MYCN amplification is associated with inferior event-free survival when compared to no MYCN amplification. Once a hypothesis is declared, a reproducible and statistically valid method for testing the hypothesis should be chosen. Every effort should be made to choose methods that reduce the risk of bias to ensure results are valid, and these methods should be declared a priori.","title":"Hypothesis-driven exploration"},{"location":"StatisticalManual/#local-hypothesis-record","text":"Users of the PCDC who conduct analyses using analytics tools are expected to maintain a record where they document hypotheses. The purpose of maintaining a hypothesis record is to guard against the statistical pitfalls outlined above and to strengthen the credibility of the research findings by verifying that a hypothesis was declared before analysis began. The hypothesis record may be a paper-based document (e.g., spiral-bound notebook) or an electronic document (e.g., Google Document, Microsoft Word) which documents each hypothesis that was analyzed using analytics tools on the PCDC. Hypotheses should be declared in the record, along with the date and time the hypothesis is declared, before any analyses begin. It is strongly preferred to maintain the hypothesis record as a document on a cloud-based service with an auditable version history (e.g., Google Document); this provides third-party verification of the date and time the hypothesis was recorded. Users may also wish to record a brief summary of the results of analyses in the hypothesis record, though this is not required. Users should electronically submit hypothesis record entries (e.g., scanned copy of handwritten hypothesis record, digital file, link to \u201ccloud\u201d-based document) along with project requests when requesting line-level access to the data. Users who do not submit a hypothesis record with a project request may be requested to submit a hypothesis record, and failure to submit a hypothesis record may result in denial of a project request. In cases of possible or suspected statistical misconduct, user activity log data may be reviewed and compared to the submitted hypothesis record.","title":"Local hypothesis record"},{"location":"StatisticalManual/#policies-and-restrictions-on-use-of-analytics-tools","text":"To meet commitments to data contributors and member consortia, and to prevent misuse of data, the PCDC has developed policies which users are expected to abide by.
